This is a starting point for JavaScript solutions to the
["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis).

In this challenge, you'll build a Redis clone that's capable of handling
basic commands like `PING`, `SET` and `GET`. Along the way we'll learn about
event loops, the Redis protocol and more.

# Stage 2 & beyond

Note: This section is for stages 2 and beyond.

1. Ensure you have `node (21)` installed locally
1. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your Redis server, which is implemented in
   `app/main.js`.
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.
